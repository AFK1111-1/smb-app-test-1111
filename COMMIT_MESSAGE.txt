fix: Restore and streamline iOS 18.1 SDK download to fix build destination error

Root Cause:
- iOS 18.1 SDK was not installed on GitHub Actions runner
- Build failed with "Unable to find a destination matching the provided destination specifier"
- Exit status: 70

Changes Made:
1. Restored iOS platform download step with streamlined verification
2. Added critical 30-second wait after download for installation to settle
3. Improved verification using xcrun simctl to check runtimes before/after
4. Added explicit sdk: "iphoneos" to Fastfile build config
5. Better error handling with specific checks for iphoneos18
6. Kept New Architecture enabled (required by react-native-reanimated 4.x)

Files Modified:
- .github/workflows/qa-release.yml - Restored and improved iOS SDK download
- fastlane/Fastfile - Added explicit SDK parameter
- Documentation updated (IOS_BUILD_FIX.md, BUILD_ERROR_DEBUG_GUIDE.md, QUICK_FIX_REFERENCE.md)

Expected Result:
- iOS 18.1 SDK will be downloaded and verified before build
- 30-second wait ensures installation completes properly
- xcodebuild will find the correct destination
- Build should proceed past the archiving stage
- No more "iOS 18.1 is not installed" errors

Testing:
- Verbose logging added to track SDK installation
- Before/after runtime state visibility
- Build logs uploaded as artifacts for debugging
- Multiple checkpoints to verify SDK availability
